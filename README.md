#Tableau Project 1: Data Visualization Dashboard
Created a Tableau dashboard using the Accelerator Program Data Set from Massachusetts to help visualize and analyze sales, profit, quantity, and trends over time. 
The project included building visualizations like column, bar, line, and pie charts to analyze sales, profit, quantity, and trends over time. 
All the visualizations were combined into one interactive dashboard.
