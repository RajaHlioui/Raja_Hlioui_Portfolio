[**Python Project 1:**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pwZAB9R3HINIg3WCDcza7XJrJ0oBWfxX?usp=sharing)
• Analyzed climate change data for five African countries (Egypt, Tunisia, Cameroon, Senegal, Angola) from 1980 to 2023, provided by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.

• Cleaned and processed the dataset to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.

• Built visualizations including line charts to illustrate temperature fluctuations in Tunisia and Cameroon, and histograms to compare temperature distributions in Senegal before and after 2000.

• Created summary charts to display the average temperature per country, identified the top three hottest countries by average temperature, and designed a map chart to visualize these insights.

• Created a Tableau dashboard using the Accelerator Program Data Set from Massachusetts to help visualize and analyze key metrics such as sales, profit, quantity, and trends over time. 

• Built visualizations, including column, bar, line, and pie charts, to provide clear insights into the data. 

• All visualizations were combined into one interactive dashboard for a comprehensive view of the dataset..

• Created a Tableau dashboard using global earthquake data to analyze and visualize key metrics such as magnitude, significance, and tsunami occurrences.

• Built visualizations, including pie charts, map charts, and custom graphs, to explore relationships and trends such as magnitude distribution, significance levels, and yearly fluctuations.

• Combined all visualizations into an interactive dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of global earthquake patterns, published on Tableau Public.
